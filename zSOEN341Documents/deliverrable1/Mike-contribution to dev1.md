##Use Case Diagrams 

This section visualizes the different users that will be interacting with the system. This is a high-level description that demonstrates how the system will function and utilized. This will give the team a better understanding of what the software should be designed to do.

##Use Cases

This section describes how all the users that are presented in the use case diagrams will interact with the software. It will also describe the importance, complexity and goal of each action, as well as the requirements and basic flow. All of this is necessary for the programmer so it can ease the process of creation, it also helps the team plan the creation of the system.

##Domain Model

This section is a diagram that displays different domain classes that represent functions of the system. This diagram gives the programmers insight how what needs to be done and also which functions interact with each other. It basically gives the programmer a high level description of what the software needs to do.

## Activities

These tables will help the team plan and organise what each member has to contribute and the minimum number of hours estimated to complete each section. It also provides the purpose of the activity that needs to be completed. The minimum number of hours and the estimate cost of production to complete this project is also included in the tables, this will come in handy once the team makes the budget for the creation of this software.


## Artifacts


### 7.2.1 Use Case Diagram

There are 5 use case diagrams constructed for this project. These use case diagrams show the different users will be interacting with the software. This is a high-level artifact that gives a quick overview of how the system will function, be designed and used. This will give the team a better understanding of what we are looking to implement as well as how the construction of the system will be done. Furthermore, the use case diagrams show how basic features interact with one another to create the final fully functioning product. 

### 7.2.2 Use Cases 

Use cases will describe how the users defined in the diagram will interact with the system. They pinpoint the importance and difficulty of each evaluated action. A proper use case will identify the type of user that will do this action and the goal that the user wants to achieve by doing so. It is also a description of the preconditions necessary for the start of the action, the basic flow to pursue to get to the post-conditions. This artifact will help the team better understand the importance when creating the software and help with the planning of which parts need to be completed in order to have a successful implementation of the task at hand. 

### 7.2.3 Domain Model

The domain model is a diagram displaying different domain classes that represent and identify every function that the system will perform. This artifact also represent how each domain class interacts with the different functions of the software. The domain model, like previous artifacts explained, gives insight on how the system and software should be created and will ease the process for the programmers when coding the software. In other words it will help them understand and give an overview of the different functions that the system will have and how they interact with the domain classes.

### 7.2.4 Human Resources

This artifact lists the capabilities of each team member, and what they will bring to the team. These include: strengths, availabilities and experience. Most importantly, the tables help dictate the most effective way of using each member, be it for design, programming, documenting and more. 

### 7.2.5 Technical Resources Table

This artifact lists the technological resources (for example software) available that this team can utilize during the whole process of building this project. A technical resource table is very important since it will help the team know exactly what to use and where. For example, not all computers at Concordia are not equipped with all the software needed to work on our application. Using the table, the team members can get a firm grasp of all the different applications that need to come together in order to build a successful prototype and final product. 

### 7.2.6 User Interface
    
User experience is the main goal when designing software and the user interface will help the front end programmers in making the layout of the system. The importance of the user interface is due to the fact if it looks well done and professional, more people will use it and be inclined to share it with others. This artifact also touches how much  the user will trust a website, if the website looks out dated and not visual appealing, the user might not think its a legitimate website that is trustworthy.

### 7.2.7 Program Source Code

This artifact is all the code that the team programmed for the system. It is the heart of the project and the most important part in terms of design and functionality. This artifact defines the software and makes it function the way we intend it to function. Without this artifact there is essentially no system. 

### 7.2.8 Test Cases

This artifact is very important since it is used to see if there are any bugs and also to see if everything is working according to plan in the system. It also will help the programmers figure out what needs to be improved, what needs fixing and what needs to be added. This artifact is essential when constructing a system, because if a systems as flaws and bugs, the user will not be inclined to use it nor trust it. A bug free software is a trustworthy software.


## Project Estimates

This software will be created, designed, debugged, tested, presented and documented in a span of 15 weeks between January 6th and April 13th. The projected cost of this software is 5100 $ spanning over a minimum of 118 hours dedicated to the conception of this project. This estimate is based on the activities tables in section 7.1 of this document and is only a minimum estimate of how much time the team will put in to complete this project. The team as a whole is completely devoted to this project and is excited to present their creation from concept to reality to the professor.

## Risk

### Team Management and Communication

Working in a team of 10 members, who never worked together before, is challenging. Lack of communication among the members might cause problems that hinder the progress of the project. Managing a big team like this one is another issue that needs to be addressed. That is why the team has been split into sub-teams assigned for different tasks.  

### Personnel Availability

Most of the members of the team either have part-time jobs and/or other factors that might hinder there availability to the project. Meeting each deliverable dates can also coincide with different course work as all of us have a full course load this semester. All of these factors can limit the dedication to the project, but as a team we have come together to well organize our time and not waste any of it during our weekly meetings.

### Learning New Languages
 
For this project, the majority of the coding team decided to use Ruby on Rails to develop this software. So for most of the other members this would be the first time using this language, which could be a problem since there is not much time or resources devoted to teaching this language. Thus the information must be self-taught and self-researched, which can be demanding due to our work and class schedules.
