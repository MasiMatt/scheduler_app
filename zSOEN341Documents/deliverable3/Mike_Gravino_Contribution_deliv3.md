# Final cost estimate


The final cost estimate for our software must be done through a certain process beginning with the planning of the development of the software all the way down to the finished product. Through this process we will
be able to properly plan and track work and manage the quality of the software from the beginning of the conceptualization all the way to the end. When calculating the final cost estimate, within this process, we 
must first give a revised version of the previous estimate, to properly understand exactly how much time and money it costed when finished building this software. Once that is completed we can now provide exact 
details on how long each individual step took in man hours for each member as well as a concrete final total of the cost of the software. 


In this section we take into account all of the phases and components of this project and give a revision of all of the estimation of artifacts previously recorded and with the cost of person hours, integration 
(design, implementation, acquisition of data), testing and documentation. The next table will gladly demonstrate our revised project estimates for the whole project:

To get a proper estimate of the cost of integration and completion of this software we decided to use a base of 35 $ per hour for every team member. This number was taken from a couple of references as an average
salary for a software engineer in this area. This table consists of all artifacts and all the aspects of the activity table previously worked on up leading to the final report and presentation. We have previously 
projected an estimated 5000 LOC (lines of code) for this software in Ruby, but we are now closer to 6000 LOC. The final product is then at a proximated 6000 LOC, we modified around 900 LOC and deleted 
approximately 950 LOC. Our total LOC up to date would be calculated using this equation (taking into account that we did not have a base version before, since we are creating the software from the ground up, 
we will be replacing the base with the current LOC):


(The numbers above were obtained through the teams repository on GitHub)


Total LOC = Current LOC - Deleted + Modified


Total LOC = 6000 - 950 + 900


Total LOC = 5950


Like explained earlier, the table above represents the final cost estimate of what we have done throughout the whole semester. The cost of integration (design, implementation, acquisition of data) has totaled 
to exactly 9,345$, which accounts for over 267 man hours and about 113 days of work throughout the semester. The cost for documenting has gone up to 8,050$, which is 230 hours dedicated from our team and 64 
days of work. Finally for testing, the cost has been calculated to 3,360$ which equates to 96 hours and 53 days of dedication from our members thus far. The table below will properly show the totals for all 
three categories and for all members:

The reason why the number of days are so high is because every member worked on multiple areas of the tasks to be estimated every day. In other words, in one day, one member can work on the documenting, 
integration and testing of the project for a number of hours and one day will be added to each category, which is the reason why the number of days are so elevated. The final project cost estimate for the 
team for this semester is 20,755$, over 593 hours dedicated by the team and a total of 230 days of effort dedicated to this software. Getting towards the end of the semester, most of the team will be working 
on multiple projects at the same time, so we took less hours per day to the development of the software but we worked more days to make up for it, as you can see later down the task table above. 


This next table is the previous final cost estimate that we generated from the last deliverable:

The previous final projected estimate between the beginning of the project from its conceptualization to its implementation and finished product we obtained an estimate of 19,950 $, over 570 hours devoted to 
the project by the entire team as well as a combined 230 days of work dedicated to this software. As you can see in the next table, we denote the difference between the final project estimate and the previous 
project estimate utilizing this equation:


(Final Cost/Previous Cost) * 100 % = Percentage difference between Final and Previous estimates.

As you can see from the table above, our final project estimate is just a bit more costly than the previous estimate from the last deliverable. This is in fact normal, since we only estimated the time we would 
devote to certain tasks not yet completed in the last deliverable, where as of now, those tasks have been completed and have been correctly logged of the amount of time dedicated, which has affected the final 
estimate with a small rise of an average of 4% for the final cost in hours and money.


The integration, documenting and testing costs are a cumulative between tasks named in the tables for the projected estimates that are delegated to its respected category. The accumulative cost was then 
calculated in two parts, the revised project estimate from the previous deliverable and the project estimates for the rest of the semester from the last deliverable. We revised the latter to give an actual 
up to date estimate that we have dedicated to each task and then added all of the tasks to its proper category (integration, documenting and testing) to give us the final project cost estimate for the semester 
as can be seen from the first 2 tables of this section.
