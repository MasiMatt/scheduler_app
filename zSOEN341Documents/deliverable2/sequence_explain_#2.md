Generate schedule based on Student Record Use Case:

            The sequence diagram shown above shows the 
            
            steps a student takes to request to register for 
            
            a specific course based on his student record. 
            
            The student can use his student record to see 
            
            which additional courses he may want to take.
            
            Once he decides to add the course of his choice, 
            
            validation steps are taken by the system to ensure
            
            that the individual meets all the necessary 
            
            requirements which allow him to successfully 
            
            sign up for the course he has chosen. 
            
            Once this validation is successfully
            
            done, the new entry is added to the 
            
            student record and he can get his 
            
            updated schedule based on 
            
            these new changes which were made.
