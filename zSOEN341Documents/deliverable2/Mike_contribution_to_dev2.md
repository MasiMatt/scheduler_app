## Introduction to part 2


This portion of the document will be presenting the design of our team which consists of  5 different views which make up the 4+1 view. These include the logical, development, Process, physical and scenarios views of the 
system. Following the 4+1 view is an overview of each subsystem where each subsystem and its public interface and classes are discussed. The next section which follows is the Detailed Design. In this section, we have the  
description of the system design and the describing each subsystem in a separate subsections. This is achieved by the use of UML class diagrams. The following section involves discussion about the Estimation, In this section, 
we discuss by  listing all identifiable modules, and calculating the revised estimate for each one and adding the cost of integration, testing and documentation. Also, we will project the estimation for all remaining work for 
the rest of the project. The next section will be the Rapid Prototyping and Risk for our software. The goal for Rapid prototyping is to lessen the risk associated to the creation of this software and this project.


## Estimation


The revised project estimate for our software must be done through a certain process beginning with the planning of the development of the software all the way down to the finished product. Through this process we will be able to properly
plan and track work and manage the quality of the software from the beginning of the conceptualization. When estimating within this process we must first acknowledge and estimate the product size and resources. Once that is completed we 
can now produce the schedule, then start with the development of the product. Once the latter has been done we then analyze the process, as in a postmortem analysis of the work that was completed.
In this section we take into account all of the phases we’ve just talked about as well as do a revision of all of the estimation of artifacts previously recorded and the cost of integration, testing and documentation. 
The next table will gladly demonstrate our revised project estimates up to now:

To get a proper estimate of the cost of integration and completion of this software we decided to use a base of 35 $ per hour for every team member. This number was taken from a couple of references as an average salary for a software 
engineer in this area. This table consists of all artifacts and all the aspects of the activity table previously worked on up to this point. We have projected an estimated 5000 LOC (lines of code) for this software in Ruby. Up to date 
we have written an approximated 4200 LOC, modified around 750 LOC and deleted approximately 800 LOC. Our total LOC up to date would be calculated using this equation (taking into account that we did not have a base version before, since
we are creating the software from the ground up, we will be replacing the base with the current LOC):


(The numbers above were obtained through the teams repository on GitHub)



Total LOC = Current LOC - Deleted + Modified


Total LOC = 4200 - 800 + 750


Total LOC = 4150



Like explained earlier, the table above represents the revised estimates of what we have done thus far. The cost of integration up to now has been approximately 6,440$, which accounts for over 184 man hours and about 45 days of work
since the beginning of the semester. The cost for documenting has gone up to 5,215$, which is 149 hours dedicated from our team and 31 days of work. Finally for testing, the cost has been calculated to 1,435$ which equates to 41 hours 
and 13 days of dedication from our members thus far. The table below will properly show the totals for all members:

The reason why the number of days are so high is because every member worked on multiple areas of the tasks to be estimated every day. In other words, in one day, one member can work on the documenting, integration and testing of the 
project for a number of hours and one day will be added to each category, which is the reason why the number of days are so elevated. Up to now the revised estimate of the project is at 13,090 $, 374 hours and 89 days of work from each
member of the team.
The next table will be the estimates for all the future work we need to get done between the submission of deliverable 2 and handing in the final report:

For the remainder of the project we have estimated every single task that still needs to be finished before submitting the final report and presenting the software. For the cost of integration, we estimate approximately 2695 $,
77 total hours from our team and over 67 days of work. For documenting, we estimate to add on up to 2345 $, 67 hours and 30 days of dedication. For testing we have an estimate of 1820 $, which accounts to 52 hours and 44 days of work.
The table below will represent those figures as well as add the previous revised estimates up until the submission of the second deliverable:

Getting towards the end of the semester, most of the team will be working on multiple projects at the same time, so we took into account that we will devote less hours per day to the development of this project but we will work more 
days to make up for it. Thus why this estimate has a lower total number of hours and the previously revised estimate up to the 2d deliverable but a higher day count. The table below will give the total projected estimate for the 
cost of integration, documenting and testing for the whole project.

The projected estimate between the beginning of the project from it’s conceptualization to its implementation and finished product we obtain an estimate of 19,950 $, over 570 hours devoted to the project by the entire team as well as
a combined 230 days of work dedicated to this software. These estimates are for every part of the project with the added costs of documenting testing and integration. This estimate, in our opinion is quite indicative of what we think
the final cost evaluation will be in the coming weeks leading up to the presentation and final report submission. The integration, documenting and testing costs are a cumulative between tasks named in the tables for the projected 
estimates that are delegated to its respected category. The accumulative cost was then calculated in two parts, the revised project estimate from the start of the project to the submission of this deliverable and from the submission 
of this deliverable to the handing in of the final report. Once combined we obtained our final project estimate of each of the integration, documenting and testing of our software, which like explained previously, is indicated in the 
table above.



## Risk



It is important to be able to identify potential problems that are liable to occur in the future. The main cause of problems in software development is lack of information. To hedge these problems we must make an effort to plan and 
prototype a reasonable amount.


When a risk is identified, we need to reduce the probability of the risk occurring and reduce its potential impact.  These risks can effectively delay our completion of deadlines such as team deadlines, deliverable deadlines as well 
as final report and presentation deadlines. Properly indicating the risks can help prevent wasting time and will help the team meet all deadlines efficiently. 



### 5.2.1 Programming Languages Used


* Not all members are familiar with the main programming language used for the back-end and front-end development 


* The learning curve in the amount of time given is quite steep for those new to the programming languages and can interfere with deadlines.


* Unfamiliarity with the programming languages used can create more issues and take more time to correct during development in the debugging stage than previously expected.



### 5.2.2 Team Management and Communication


* A team of 10 members that have never worked together before can present certain problems, such as clearly and timely communicating with each other.


* Managing a team of 10 members can be quite hard as well, making sure everybody has equal work to accomplish and not too much so that they will go over deadlines we set out.






### 5.2.3 Personnel Availability

    
* All members of the team have full course loads as well as a full class schedule, some also have part-time jobs, so personnel availability can have a huge strain on the meeting of deadlines. The availability of every member of the team can also hinder their dedication to the project, which can increase the risk of handing-in sub-par work.


* It will also be hard to schedule team meetings where all 10 members can be present to work on deliverables together and meet specific deadlines, this can also effect communication between team members and completion of work.




### 5.2.4 Time Constraints


* The whole project has to be completed in the winter semester, which gives us very limited time to conceptualize, create, implement, design, test and document software from the ground up.


* The very limited time constraints can play a role with the quality of the final product if we don’t plan accordingly. 




By identifying the risks, the whole team can now focus on how to plan accordingly and try and prevent these risks by working in the right direction. Based on those risks, we have come up with countermeasures to mitigate them like 
described in the first deliverable, for example, schedule team meetings on a weekly basis, delegate work to members strengths as well as develop prototypes to properly assess and obtain all of the requirements of the product.
