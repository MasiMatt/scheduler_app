Introduction to part 2


This portion of the document will be presenting the design of our team which consists of  5 different views which make up the 4+1 view. 
These include the logical, development, Process, physical and scenarios views of the system. Following the 4+1 view is an overview of each subsystem where
each subsystem and its public interface and classes are discussed.
The next section which follows is the Detailed Design. In this section, we have the  
description of the system design and the describing each subsystem in a separate subsections. 
This is achieved by the use of UML class diagrams. The following section involves discussion about the Estimation, In this section, we discuss by  listing all identifiable modules, 
and calculating the revised estimate for each one and adding the cost of integration, testing and documentation.

Also, we will project the estimation for all remaining work for the rest of the project. 
The next section will be the Rapid Prototyping and Risk for our software. 

 The goal for Rapid prototyping is to lessen the risk associated to the creation of this software and this project.
