The diagrams of  

(System Sequence Diagram #1 and System Sequence Diagram #2 shown below) 

present the interaction between the Student 

actor and the System during the  two major 

use-cases, presented previously in the activity

diagrams:Register for a Course According to Preference 

and Generate schedule based on Student Record.

In both cases, several calls are made to the

System to identify any possible issues that

may occur during the registration process.

Information is returned primarily in the

form of course lists and section lists 

which are technically in the student record

which is returned back to the student on his

request, ensuring that the user is not 

interacting with a course that may not 

fit in their time(day) preference 

or which is not part of the prerequisite.
