5.1 Rapid Prototyping and Risk
Rapid Prototyping

Rapid prototyping is used to reduce the risks associated with a project. Rapid prototyping can reduce risks early in the project to avoid expensive costs associated with fixing problems in later stages of development.
 When building software that has complexity and potentially it is important to prototype. Prototyping significantly reduces the risk of overlooking a bug or unwanted behavior. This approach makes projects less prone to cost overruns and delays. 
 
 Moreover, the early prototyping allows us to see what our final project will begin to look like at an early stage. This allows us to fix general errors and come up with new ideas early on in the 
 development of our project instead of later on when it is a lot harder to change things.
